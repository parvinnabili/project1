# Building a Database project - MySQL
## By Parvin Nabili
### For this project, I built a database system for a Bank (namely "The Bank of Azerbaijan") and run several queries to drive insights. The following was developed:

- Conceptual Data Model
- Logical Data Model
- Database Design

### The ER Diagram of the Bank is as follows:

### The SQL code for creating the database: https://github.com/parvinnabili/project1/blob/b64f67c4f464ce1de73e453078eba84658813710/BankOfAzerbaijan.sql
### The SQL code for queries: https://github.com/parvinnabili/project1/blob/b64f67c4f464ce1de73e453078eba84658813710/BankOfAzerbaijan_queries.sql
